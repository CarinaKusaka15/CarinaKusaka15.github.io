title: Development of a structured decision-making (SDM) tool for seabird habitat management
summary: The Oregon Coast hosts 1.3 million seabirds of 15 species that provide economic and ecological services such as ecotourism and serving as sentinels of ocean health. Consistent with global trends, the Oregon Coast National Wildlife Refuge recorded up to 90% declines in some seabird populations, like the tufted puffin, since the 1980s. Seabirds, dependent on both marine and terrestrial resources, are disproportionately vulnerable to climate change. In 2023, refuge managers began invasive plant removal, but uncertainty remains regarding seabird response to management under climate conditions. With declining populations, limited time and resources, and major knowledge gaps, local managers face the challenge of prioritizing actions that will have the largest positive impact. Partnering with the USFWS and USGS, I am developing a spatial structured decision-making (SDM) tool that integrates habitat, occupancy, and climate data, and expert knowledge to support conservation efforts. As a PhD student, I mapped habitat changes over time using 30 years of aerial imagery and field surveys. To expand this work, I will integrate my research findings and expert knowledge into a spatial SDM tool, offering managers insights into seabird responses to management action prior to implementation. This work is especially timely, as it will help improve urgent restoration priorities, and inform updates to the Comprehensive Conservation Plan and State of the Birds Report.  
More coming soon.
