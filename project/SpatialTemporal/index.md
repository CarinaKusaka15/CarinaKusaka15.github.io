title: Spatial-temporal analysis of seabird breeding habitat and links to marine-driven fluctuations 
summary: Seabirds are among the most threatened birds globally, with the loss or deterioration of coastal breeding habitats posing a severe threat. Anthropogenic disturbances substantially influence coastal ecosystems through erosion and vegetation loss, altering habitat for the wildlife species that depend on them. In addition to these disturbances, oceanographic processes may play an important role in shaping the quality of breeding habitats; however, there is limited information on how habitat conditions for burrow nesting seabirds have changed over time, and whether these changes are related to specific oceanographic or climatic factors. Over the last 30 years, populations of several burrow nesting seabird species including tufted puffin (Fratercula cirrhata) and rhinoceros auklet (Cerorhinca monocerata), which breed on offshore islands, have sharply declined along the Oregon Coast. To better understand the potential factors driving these declines, we conducted a spatiotemporal analysis of critical burrow nesting seabird breeding habitat within the Oregon Coast NWRC. Specifically, we quantified vegetative cover on 16 islands from 1992 to 2022 using a combination of empirical data, historical aerial photography (1992–2005), and aerial photography from the National Agriculture Imagery Program (2005–2022). Results showed cyclical fluctuations in vegetation cover coast-wide, which were closely related to large scale oceanographic oscillations. Specifically, vegetation cover was negatively correlated with the winter Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and positively correlated with the spring El Nino Southern Oscillation. Understanding these long-term changes in seabird breeding habitat will guide habitat restoration, invasive species removal, and other adaptive management decisions.
