title: Planes, Plants, and Predictions: Comparing high-resolution imagery from NAIP, drones, and manned aerial vehicles (MAV) to map island vegetation communities using two machine learning algorithms 
summary: Aerial photography is an increasingly common tool for monitoring wildlife populations and habitats, particularly on offshore islands where field data collection is logistically challenging. In this study, we compare the utility high resolution aerial imagery from three sources—National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP), Manned aerial vehicles (MAV), and Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV; drones)—and two machine learning algorithms to classify and map vegetative communities. Specifically, we used four islands off the Oregon Coast to demonstrate the use of multiple photography sources and machine learning algorithms to identify and map invasive vegetation cover and native communities. We determined the relative importance of topographic and spectral features on the classification of landcover types. These results will inform future habitat monitoring strategies, guiding decisions on the most effective remote sensing methods for invasive plant management and seabird habitat conservation.
